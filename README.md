1. create product listing in products.html with jQuery using products.js
2. when user clicks add to cart button, that product would add to cart (array)
3. display cart below products listing
4. if any existing element in cart is added again then quantity would increase by 1
5. give option to change quantity manually in cart for any product
6. user can delete product from cart
